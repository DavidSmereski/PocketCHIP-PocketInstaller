        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Freedroid is a fairly faithful port of the classic game Paradroid. The player controls a parasitic robot
          (use the cursor keys to move) as it moves through a ship filled with robots that have gone crazy
          and are planning wanton destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spacebar will advance you through opening screens. The paradroid can directly shoot other robots
          (press the spacebar while moving) or can try and latch onto other robots and take them over (press the
          spacebar while staying still and touching another robot). Taking over another robot takes a little
          practice; you'll see an influence screen that'll represent the battle for the other robot's mind.
          Within this screen you can at first pick your color with the cursor keys, and then once the battle
          proper starts you can press the spacebar on individual lines to set them to your color. Some lines
          have branches; some have dead ends; some have repeaters. You'll learn how each works pretty quickly.
          You can only set so many lines per battle, so choose carefully. Different robots have wildly different
          capabilities. They can be easier or harder to control, and can have different weapons systems and
          armor. When you control a robot you get its weapons and armor, but note that the more advanced robots
          are harder to control. You're pretty vulnerable when you're not controlling another robot, so you
          should try and get control over one pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll need to interact with various ship systems. Consoles can provide you with information on your
          location and the robots that are in your area. To use one, move next to it and press the spacebar, and
          use the cursor keys to browse through the available information. Elevators will move you from one level
          to another; you've probably guessed that to use one you go on top of it and press the spacebar and use
          the cursor keys to select your target level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freedroid offers additional skins beyond the original classic Paradroid look. You can get at these
          skins (plus other special features) by pressing the escape key and browsing the features with the
          cursor keys.
