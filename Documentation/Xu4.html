        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Ultima IV is an involved game, one that changed the world of RPGs forever. It makes use of almost the
          full keyboard, and it's strongly encouraged that the player download and read the reference manuals via
          the links above to really get into the game. The game comes with a cloth map (with some parts of the world
          unknown for the player to explore on his or her own) and a spellbook (with a couple spells unknown and
          others having easier versions for the player to discover) in addition to a full manual and quick player
          reference. You'll need all of these to win, and as they're written from the perspective of someone within
          the fantasy world prevented they're reasonably entertaining on their own.
        </p>

        <p>
          To get started right away, note that one can get to the initial menu from the title screen by pressing the
          spacebar, and a menu item can be quickly selected by typing its first letter. You don't get to design your
          own character; you'll instead be asked a series of questions that take some measure of your personality.
          Your answers will influence the character that gets created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you're in the game proper you can use the cursor keys to move around and most of the other keys on
          the keyboard have commands associated with them. The Players Guide has all the details, but a few really
          useful ones are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>a</dt>
          <dd>Attack.</dd>
          <dt>b</dt>
          <dd>Board a ship or mount a horse.</dd>
          <dt>c</dt>
          <dd>Cast a spell, assuming you've already got one prepared.</dd>
          <dt>e</dt>
          <dd>Enter.</dd>
          <dt>h</dt>
          <dd>Hole up and camp to rest, eat, and hopefully heal.</dd>
          <dt>r</dt>
          <dd>Ready a weapon; okay to use in battle.</dd>
          <dt>s</dt>
          <dd>Searches an area.</dd>
          <dt>t</dt>
          <dd>Talk.</dd>
          <dt>w</dt>
          <dd>Wear armor, takes too long to do in battle, so get ready first.</dd>
          <dt>z</dt>
          <dd>Ztatus; yeah, the <q>s</q> was already used.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Some commands require that certain items are owned, that you're in a certain location, or
          other special situations. With a little help from the Players Guide and Manual you'll figure
          these out pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're going to want to talk to pretty much everyone you can. You can type single words to prompt
          them for responses. Most people respond to things like <q>name</q>, <q>job</q>, and <q>health</q>.
          Most people also respond to topical items that you pull from conversations with them, or get told
          by other people to ask them about.
        </p>
        <h2>PocketC.H.I.P. Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          This PocketInstaller version of Xu4 makes use of the DOS version of Ultima IV (that has been legally
          released as freeware) and the U4 Upgrade project (that fixes some bugs and brings the graphics and
          sound more in line with what was released for Ultima V).
